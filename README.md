# Memberpress
Custom code for Memberpress

courseProgress code is used in either the functions.php file in your wordpress installation or a code snippets plugin. You need to alter the server location, add course IDs into the array and the total number of stages of your course.

This will add a widget to the dashboard area that displays the progress of each student through a Memberpress course.
